# Popular Movies, Stage 1
## Android Developer Nanodegree Project

This project uses themoviedb.org's API (thank you, good people) to display a grid of movie posters, which on click will display a small description.

The version uploaded here is (very) slightly different from the one submitted to Udacity. It has an extra (informational) error message about not having a valid API key*, updated SDK versions (leading to removal of some conditional elements, which checked for the higher SDK which is now the minimum).




This repo may have a few contributions some time later. As of this writing (17 Nov 2017), while I focus on ML, I am waiting for Udacity to include Kotlin in their Android Nanodegree program as the current submissions are in Java. When that happens, I may enroll and this may be updated, and may be in Kotlin.


*_That reminds me: you need a valid API Key from themoviedb.org, it goes into app/build.gradle on line 20._
